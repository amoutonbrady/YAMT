There's not much to say. [Svelte V3](https://svelte.dev) got realesed last week and I've been dying to try it out.

There are a lot of concepts that I really like about it and I think this mini project has helped me figuring out most of them.

From Store, to component, to reactive variables and conditional rendering as well as animations, I've been able to be somewhat productive in little to no time. Things just worked right away without any hicups.
