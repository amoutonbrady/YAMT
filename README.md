# YAMT (Yet Another Morse Translator)

There's not much to say. [Svelte V3](https://svelte.dev) got realesed last week and I've been dying to try it out.

There are a lot of concepts that I really like about it and I think this mini project has helped me figuring out most of them.

From Store, to component, to reactive variables and conditional rendering as well as animations, I've been able to be somewhat productive in little to no time. Things just worked right away without any hicups.

Thanks to:

* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) which is the reason of this repo.
* [js-morse](https://github.com/zhikiri/js-morse) from where I got the actual `decode` & `encode` functions. I refactored it a little bit to suit my needs.
* [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) for the generation of favicon & open graph meta tags.
* [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for some of the icons.
* [FlatUIColors](https://flatuicolors.com/palette/fr) for the colors.
